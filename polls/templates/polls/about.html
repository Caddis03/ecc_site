            <h1>WHO WE ARE</h1>
            <h2>We are an immigrant church serving Ethiopians and Eritreans in the Tampa area.</h2>
            <h1>OUR BELIEFS</h1>
            <h2><li>We believe the Scriptures are inspired by God and declare His design and plan for mankind.</li> 
                <li>We believe there is only One True God–revealed in three persons, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.</li> 
                <li>We believe in the Deity of the Lord Jesus Christ. As God's son Jesus was both human and divine.</li> 
                <li>We believe though originally good, man willingly fell to sin–ushering evil and death, both physical and spiritual, into the world.</li>
                <li>We believe every person Can Have Restored Fellowship with God Through 'Salvation' (trusting Christ, through faith and repentance, to be our personal Savior).</li>
                <li>We believe and practice two ordinances— (1) Water Baptism by Immersion after repenting of one's sins and receiving Christ's gift of salvation, and (2) Holy Communion (the Lord's Supper) as a symbolic remembrance of Christ's suffering and death for our salvation.</li>
                <li>We believe the Church has a Mission to seek and save all who are lost in sin.</li>
                <li>We believe 'the Church' is the Body of Christ and consists of the people who, throughout time, have accepted God's offer of redemption (regardless of religious denomination) through the sacrificial death of His son Jesus Christ.</li>
                <li>We believe in The Blessed Hope—when Jesus Raptures His Church Prior to His Return to Earth (the second coming). At this future moment in time all believers who have died will rise from their graves and will meet the Lord in the air, and Christians who are alive will be caught up with them, to be with the Lord forever.</li></h2>
